#Design Concepts
CSS Zen Garden

When Looking at the examples, I noticed a couple things. Many designs are not responsive and most require a lot of scrolling. Designs I enjoyed very much were: Dazzling Beauty 195, Vin Rouge 179 and Steel 219. 

Dazzling is, well… dazzling. It’s very pretty. The type created in photoshop with a soft glow and combined with the flower as bullet points is real nice. Cons: It has lots of vertical scrolling and is not responsive. This may be because of when it was made.

Vin Rouge: I like this because of the way containers appear to fade into each other. It gives the page, flow. I suspect that what is really happening is careful use of background image colors.

Steel is cool! It’s responsive Xs 2! It responds to the page size and it responds to my cursor. I like that. The page seems to engage with me right away. I also like; no scrolling. All the information is presented easy to see, to read and access. 

I immediately wanted to go in this direction, so I have: (CssZenGardenWireFrame_V1.pdf). Then I started looking at the code for Steel and thought it looks intimidating. I moved on to: (CssZenGardenWireFrame_V2.pdf). Looking at the top of this pdf, you see, the page starts with a simple picture and header. When you hover on it, a waterfall appears (get it? CSS, waterfall?). When you click on the waterfall, it takes you to the actual web page. Again too complicated and probably can’t be done without changing the HTML (which is against the rules). 
At the bottom of the PDF, I just start organizing the page elements and attempt to reduce the scrolling. This lead me to (CssZenGardenWireFrame_V3.pdf). Here I used Indesign to make the wireframe I’d started on paper. While I was doing this, I thought of another web site I saw.
In the previous assignment, I saw a piece made by Aaron Highlands. In it He put the Aside, on the side and made it move using CSS’s transition feature. The code in Steel may be beyond me, but I can follow what Aaron did and I thought I might be able to use Aaron’s idea to do something kind of like Steel. This brings me to: (CssZenGardenWireFrame_V4a.pdf [and V4b]). Here, I start with a very clean scene. There is a header, water cascading into a pool and there are a couple of other things (buttons or text). When you click on them, the text cascades down into the pool. There are a lot of unknowns (for me) in trying this. I may end up with a kind of hybrid of V3 & V4. I’ve done a couple tests already and It looks possible to at least try.
